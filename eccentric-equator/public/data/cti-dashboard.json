    "summary": "The threat intelligence indicates that a sophisticated cyberattack targeting individuals has been detected across multiple hosts, primarily using SSH (Port 22), RDP (Port 3389), and SMB (Port 445) protocols. The attack leverages known vulnerabilities such as CVE-2008-3844, CVE-2019-16905, CVE-2016-20012, CVE-2021-36368, and the critical CVE-2025-26465. The attackers are employing a variety of techniques including brute force attacks (T1041), credential access (T1110), user execution (T1204), and data exfiltration over command-and-control channels (T1078). This attack is particularly concerning due to its sophistication, targeting individuals with high-value payloads.\n\n###",
