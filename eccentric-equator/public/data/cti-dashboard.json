For example, the Qilin hacking group's claim about the Anabuki Kosan attack was discussed on @H4ckmanac within 85 hours of the infrastructure finding (98.142.218.43:445).\n- CVEs and Vulnerabilities: Multiple social media posts discuss vulnerabilities like CVE-2026-1731, which is also found in the infrastructure findings.\n- Causal vs. Coincidental Events: The majority of events are causally related; for instance, discussions about ransomware attacks often precede or coincide with infrastructure findings indicating active exploitation.",
